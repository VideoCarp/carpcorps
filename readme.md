To join us and become a creator for Carp Corps, you need to join our discord (linked above) and DM VideoCarp#1591,
there is a join us channel in the discord server which you can refer to if you want but all the text in it is here.
To join us, please DM me. You will have your own link, your own MCPEDL account using this server however. 
We will announce whenever you make a new map/addon/etc.
**You can also open a ticket or run mod mail through c!modmail to notify me.**
**As a creator you also gain access to all patron perks (go to the next title).**
