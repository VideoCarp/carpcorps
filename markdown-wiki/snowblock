A unique never before used idea for skyblock. This skyblock map, is a little different. Are you tired of grinding cobblestone for hours just to build a small bridge? Well in this unique map, it’s far easier! You can use snow from snow golems to bridge. However, of course, cobblestone is essential to the game but you don’t start out with it. Getting ores is also possible with the custom generator. With shops, with villagers, with the new Minecraft BEES, with our QUEST UPDATE, with  custom islands and our  AUTO-MINERS, and most recently, our newest morph.

Over 16 islands! (Including shops and such, excluding the custom islands).




This map is created 100% vanilla and works with 1.13. In this unique map you can defeat the ender dragon and possibly even the Wither. Killing the ender dragon won’t be your biggest challenge. The Wither will be. Since the Wither flies 95% of the time out of your reach and has a stage when you can’t hit it with projectiles, it’ll certainly be a challenge when you have to take every step carefully. Keep inventory is enabled, to disable just do /gamerule keep inventory false.

Reaching the nether is 100% possible. It may not seem very possible to light a portal without a flint and steel or a fire charge but in fact, it is. Lava is your key. Created by VideoCarp1. YOUTUBE: GAMER123 TPT.

If you want ores, stay near the ore generator. You can also get chicken, sheep and cows from the nearby spawners. Difficulty is set on hard.

Shops and bees have been added! You can now avoid grinding 10 hours on the ore generator in the other islands and buy diamonds for coins!!

Villagers have also been added. You can unlock literally anything.

Including prismarine items because of the new quest update!
